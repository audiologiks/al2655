Guide to web client templates for accessing voice menus and other features
======
Repository for code for a desktop client, written in php and html. Example use cases areL
* Used for a meetup in Tokyo to encourage members to engage in exchange languages and to attend the Meetup.
* To access audio files with buttons
* Used to showcase interactive audio content

**Code** is based on Twilio platform, at the url https://www.twilio.com . All rights to their code examples below to them. The MIT license only covers sample code I post here.

Folders
===
**Logiks** -  In this folder are examples of voice menu scripts and code to initiate different features.

**Client** - In this folder are examples of soft, desktop client html code that I post to share. Using tables from the database_table repo and dialpads in the kb-Articles repo.

**Twiml** - Examples from Twilio website that I download to work on as examples, or code for voice features that I have adapted.

# How Does this Work with:

* [Interactive Voice Menus](https://github.com/audiologiks/interactive-voice-menus) - The webclients connect to voice menus on different topics with different feature sets.

* [Database Tables](https://github.com/audiologiks/database_tables) - I use database tables for links to content on the webpage on the webclient. Groups of content are organized by table.

* [Dialpads](https://github.com/audiologiks/kb-Articles/blob/master/Images/dialpad/dialpad_icons_1.md) - Different dialpads can be created to allow users access to features of the interactive voice menus.
