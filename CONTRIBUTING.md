How to contribute
====
I started this to share information on Meetups on finding a job in Japan and overseas. 

If there is some information here that you would like to contribute to, edit or add entirely new content, please feel free to submit a pull request with your suggested edits or additions. 

The only guideline for content submission is that the content should:
* supplement existing content on searching for jobs
* be on the subject of practicing interview questions or answers
* or be on learning English or Japanese for oneâ€™s career

Just download the existing repository and submit any changes you think would make it more usable for visitors and meetup members.

Here are some important resources:

* [Audiologiks wiki](https://github.com/audiologiks/kb-Articles/wiki) tells you where we are,
* Our [roadmap](https://github.com/audiologiks/kb-Articles/wiki/Roadmap) is the 10k foot view of where we're going, 
* Our [project] is our day-to-day project management space.
* Mailing list: Join our community [mailing list on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/audiologiks/app/100265896690345/?ref=page_internal)
* Bugs? Open an [issue](https://github.com/audiologiks/kb-Articles/issues) report them 

**Testing and Corrections**
For our Voice Menu pages, as well as other content pages, i am happy to receive suggestions, edits and the results of any testing. 

**Submitting changes**
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to audiologiks with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). When you send a pull request, please be as complete as you can in describing the edits and new features or content. 

We can always use more user cases and sample voice menus. 

Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are one feature per commit.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


**Coding conventions**
Start reading our code and look at markdown tutorials for the content, as well as twilio.com for sample code snippets. If you want to write code of other platforms, I am happy to post it here, but we use Twilio as the main platform for interactive voice menus, such as the ones in the public repo.
