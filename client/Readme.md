I use web clients to access the voice menus stored on the Audiologiks platform

* To make calls domestically and internationally
* To record calls where desired to keep a record and where possible to share it
* To record, store and share audio notes
* To create interactive content on the web pages and link with interactive menus

The different web templates are written in php, html and include javascript code snippets.
