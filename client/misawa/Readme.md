About Misawa web clients
===
This is to record and share web client templates for use in specific communities

I use web clients to access the voice menus stored on the Audiologiks platform, with a theme around specific communities

**Update**
3/22/2018 Adde app for Meetup to engage attendees. It is meant to be in php, just uploaded the html code. Missing part with Twilio details, but users can add their own.

* To make calls domestically and internationally
* To record calls where desired to keep a record and where possible to share it
* To record, store and share audio notes
* To create interactive content on the web pages and link with interactive menus

The different web templates are written in php, html and include javascript code snippets.
