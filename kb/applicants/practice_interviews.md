### Interview Preparation

- Directions: 
  - Use this checklist to keep track of your activities as you prepare for and conduct an interview. 
  - You can indicate whether you have completed a particular activity by placing an X in the left-hand column. 
  - You can also record your notes at the bottom of the checklist. 

**Activity**
1. Arrive early and review your questions. 
2. If you are conducting your interview over the phone or via an app, set time aside before the call to review your questions and then call the person you are interviewing at the agreed-upon time. 
3. Introduce yourself and ask for permission to record the interview. 
4. Explain why you are conducting the interview.  
5. If you are recording, test the recording service by making a practice call with your phone or pc. 
6. Ask your questions clearly and be ready to respond with follow-up questions. 
7. Allow the person you are interviewing a chance to answer your questions fully. 
8. Don’t insist on strictly following your list of interview questions; if discussion naturally flows in another, useful direction, be prepared to shift your line of questioning 
9. Take notes. A set of handwritten notes will serve as a backup in case of technical glitches and will help you remember ideas you had during the interview. 
10. Leave your contact information when the interview is over. 
11. Provide a way for the person you interview to reach you to change or add anything to his or her comments. 
12. Send a thank-you note. 
13. Let the person you interviewed know how much you appreciated the opportunity to learn from him or her.
14. Confirm that the person received a link to the audio or notes of the interview.
