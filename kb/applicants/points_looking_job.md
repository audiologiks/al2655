  <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Looking for a new job</span></strong><br>
  I'll post information on looking for jobs as I get it or find anything on the
  web. One key for many jobs is to
  <span class="wysiwyg-underline">improve your ability in Japanese and English</span>
  as it can always distinguish you from others in your field. No matter how tough
  it can be, small improvements can lead to results in interviews and in the job
  so coming up with ways to learn and practice is always a good thing.

  <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Picking a recruiter </span></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Getting contacted by a recruiter is helpful not only for the immediate job opportunity
  but for the information they are willing to share. You can learn a lot about
  the Tokyo job market by talking to a recruiter in your industry.

  <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Job boards</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Bilingual or international job boards are another helpful way of learning about
  types of jobs open and the salaries they are likely to pay.
