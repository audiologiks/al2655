**Looking for startups**
via Meetups, Justa.io and Angelist or [The Bridge](http://thebridge.jp/en/) 

The lead time for a job can be up to 3 months from resume submission to offer, with 4 or more interviews in office or via phone/video. Can be shorter for internships with a view to being permanent.

### Interview preparation
I believe it is good to include Japanese in the interview, even if you are N3 or N4 (JLPT levels).

* Go Aisatsu
Simple greeting to the interviewer, shows knowledge of the culture and willingness to learn and use Japanese
* Jiko Shokai
 *It gets better with practice and can be a good summary of who you are. Simple and short is fine.*

* Thank you
 *Concluding the Japanese part of the interview or leaving the interview, it is always good to say thanks.*

* Keigo
If you know keigo great, but not necessary to worry about it during the interview. Japanese level is evaluated but even if you don’t know keigo, if you have a good command of business Japanese, or just are able to express yourself in standard Japanese, that is fine. Language ability is a threshold but keigo is very rarely the determining factor for a foreign hire.

* Other languages
If you know other languages it is a plus if they have a use within the hiring company

 *Language of the home country - English, a European or Asian language, and/or any language in which the company conducts business in its home area.*

 **Asian language** - If the Asia headquarters is outside of Japan, it can be useful or beneficial to have command of Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese). Just a nice to have element on the resume unless you are specifically involved in supporting Chinese customers. 

On the other hand, if it isn’t related to the company’s business, there is no need to include a language unless there is fluency unless it’s an ongoing hobby or interest you want to mention in the interview.

### Determining Salary
Recruiters can be a big help in determining salaries, range for the position and whether your desired salary is reachable. Job portals and online websites also have good benchmarks.

* Check out Daijob’s [salary database of candidates](https://www.daijob.com/en/ecompany/index.html) Can be a good view of the competition out there on the market 
* [Look at the type of jobs available by salary level](https://www.daijob.com/en/jobs/?pg=0)
* [Careercross has a good salary guide](https://www.careercross.com/en/salary-survey)

 * [Robert Walters Japan salary guide](https://www.robertwalters.co.jp/content/dam/robert-walters/country/japan/files/salary-survey/E-Book2017.pdf)
 * [Hays Salary check](https://www.hays.co.jp/en/salary-check/index.htm)

### Resume/CV Style
Check your resume or ask someone you trust to review it. It should be in active voice, tying your actions to the results of your employer to show your value to the company.

Japanese and English versions of a resume are good to submit, hiring managers might prefer to use the Japanese version during the interview. It can be in the same format as your English resume, unless specifically requested to submit in “rirekisho” format.

### Self-education, Training resources
I use Youtube quite a lot, to view topics related to work that I am interested in. So for me, IT and Operations topics have a lot of resources on Youtube that give good overviews or summaries of topics. Topics I enjoy are Kanban and Devops.

I have also used [Linkedin’s Lynda platform](https://www.lynda.com/) for online courses

Since I am interested in coding for the web, I have used [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
