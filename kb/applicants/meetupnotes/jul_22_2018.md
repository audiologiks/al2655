Goals of Working Abroad or in Japan
- Is Money the first priority or just getting a visa? 
  - Setting your goals will help determine your flexibility in accepting different offers. 
  - It is good to show a long-term commitment to an employer and how your experience matches with the employer. 
  - Showing some knowledge of the language when you want to work in another country can only help, even if you are still at a beginning level, because it shows a willingness to engage and understand the culture of your host country.

- What Job Roles are you Experienced in and Where can you apply to?
  - Popular job roles for foreigners are going to be specialist roles, whether in Japan or overseas. 
  - How are you more qualified than a native resident/citizen of that country? 
  - Language can be one edge, international experience is another area of specialization. 
  - Think about new job categories that your experience can prepare you for and also that you are interested in working in.
