Documentation on Japanese Company Research
==
This is for researching public companies, and using different documentation tools, like Slideshare, Scribd, Google Docs and Github to manage information about companies.

The information is for different uses, but to help get more information for presentations and analysis by users to make better decisions.
For FinTech, I will use the Nikkei 225 index to upload information on 115 global publicly-listed Japanese companies in about 20 industries. I will add other companies, both foreign and domestic to show more context to the results so as to come to a conclusion about the trends in different industries.

However, this is mostly about tasks in managing documents, less about analyzing them.
