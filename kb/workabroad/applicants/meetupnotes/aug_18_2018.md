### Topics
* Transferring internally - competing against local candidates in the country for chances
* All things being equal, you have to be a better candidate than a local candidate due to the requirement for a visa. The biggest barrier is the visa, which for example, is laid out in Government websites such as the United Kingdom.  https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/work-visas However, inside a company, references and personal introductions can carry more weight, and on global teams your expertise might mean more. If your expertise is in a sector, check out websites and media in your sector to find competitors who might be looking for people to hire https://tender-retail.acceo.com/blog/chinas-leading-mobile-payments-apps-are-forcing-competitors-to-innovate-2/ 
* Getting recommendations from people or colleagues
* Asking for referrals from former colleagues or managers can help with jobs in your company, or in the country you want to work. If you have had an internship or some experience working in the country you want to move to, reach out to them to ask about getting a reference.

Reach out to a ex-colleague or friend to ask about jobs at their companies or in the industry.


Find out the job portals for that industry or that country and look online for jobs. If you work in a large global company, check out global opportunities in your company. At a recent meetup, we had one member who had progressed to interviews but hadn’t managed to get an offer yet. We talked about competing with local candidates and how to show different attributes that give a candidate an edge over others.


Storing your resume in the cloud, with services like Dropbox, Google Drive or others gives you an easy way to access for editing or to send via email. Downloading your resume and updating to reflect your latest experience, training or other achievements is essential.


Applying for a job can be a continuous process of looking, identifying jobs you are interested in and then following the application process. And then repeating that process for the next job. Trying to improve your job search and the way you search for jobs that fit your goals and experience.


Many companies, global companies and others, use an Applicant Tracking System which has a number of boxes to fill out online and integrates with their HR systems for better management of the hiring process. However, it is a time-consuming process and requires correcting any information that doesn’t get reflected correctly after uploading or pasting details. So it is not always a fun experience, similar to filling out other types of forms online.


Make sure you have your latest copy handy when you see a job you want to apply for, and that you have checked it out to ensure it says what you want and relates to the job you are applying for.


Get used to looking for and talking with recruiters who have jobs in your field. If they don’t have a job, they might know other recruiters in their company with interesting jobs or they can give you feedback on what jobs they have. You should be able to meet new recruiters and ask questions about their focus and whether your background meets their specialty area.


While some people are uncomfortable with posting their details on social sites like Linkedin due to the visibility to others, worries about their current company seeing it, and approaches from people and companies they don’t know, it does have many jobs posted by companies listed on its job section. It is worth filling out a bare bones profile with a minimum level of data, including just abbreviated last names, etc. in order to use the site to look for jobs and apply. You can alway apply directly on a company’s website or upload a resume for a job.




If you get an email or IM or phone call, you can schedule an appointment to have a phone call or interview. Or you can cold call a recruiter and ask to make an appointment to come in and talk about your job search.


Calling to a recruiter or returning a phone call is more proactive and enables you to form a closer relationship with a recruiter or hiring manager.


A good step forward is getting the call, IM or email from a recruiter to come in and meet. Even if it is just to meet the recruiter and other members of their company, it is a good chance to advertise yourself. If it is a phone interview with the hiring company, just go over the basic background with the recruiter, if you have one, before the interview and any questions you can ask. It could be up to 3 or more interviews as part of the process, so it is best to prepare your introduction, how you can help the company in the role and examples of how you have succeeded in your current company and in the past.


One step is uploading a current version of your resume into the recruiter’s website, hiring company system or job portal along with the details for contacting you and your interest in any listed job opportunities.


Many jobs offer the opportunity to write a cover letter to explain why you want the job and what you offer in your experience and skills to benefit the company if given the role.It can be as long or as short as you want, and should be a good explanation of your interest in the role.


Look for jobs that require the same experience and skills you currently use (and offer new things to learn), and then look at the titles of those roles.

Give Yourself some Credit and Take a Bow


If you have identified a company you want to work for and joined their talent community, you will have signed up for emails highlighting new jobs that they have. This can help you learn about new jobs in areas you want to move to, or to learn about new roles that can use your skills. Try to log on or open the emails periodically to check what is happening.


If you have used a job portal to look for jobs online, check out how many are out there, or ones that you haven’t used before. But if you are regularly checking and using them to apply for jobs, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s important to be tackling these kinds of tasks regularly in your job search, as long as you are looking to change your position.



If you have updated and rewritten your resume for a job role you are applying for, that’s great. Some companies, it’s been said, use filters for keywords in certain resumes to highlight desired experience and jobs and it is good to try different styles to show how your skills match the job you are applying for. It is more work and effort but it’s good to budget time to go over your resume to compare with the job spec as it is written.
