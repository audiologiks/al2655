<p>Why would politics and economy affect a person's decision to work in a country? Political stabilty can affect the economy, leading to the supply of jobs and whether companies can hire foreigners. Even if you are a non-political person, it's good to understand if politics can impact how quickly you can find a job and get a visa.</p>

  "Hong Kong has a free market economy, highly dependent on international trade
  and finance - the value of goods and services trade, including the sizable share
  of reexports, is about four times GDP. Hong Kong has no tariffs on imported goods,
  and it levies excise duties on only four commodities, whether imported or produced
  locally: hard alcohol, tobacco, hydrocarbon oil, and methyl alcohol. There are
  no quotas or dumping laws.""

  "Hong Kong continues to link its currency closely to the US dollar, maintaining
  an arrangement established in 1983. Excess liquidity, low interest rates and
  a tight housing supply have caused Hong Kong property prices to rise rapidly.
  The lower and middle-income segments of the population increasingly find housing
  unaffordable."
