# Country Perspective: Canada

Have you decided where you want to live?

If you have decided you want to live in Canada, how will you decide where to live? Do you have an interest in a specific city? Is there a job, hobby, sport or other field which is centered in a part of Canada? People can decide to live overseas for many reasons but the one thing they have in common is that they have made it a priority for them to take that risk and embark on the challenge of living in a new country.
Creating a plan to live in another country

Unless you have arranged everything before you leave (job, place to live, visa etc.), then you will most likely have to plan to arrange some parts of your living arrangements after moving to a new country. The first thing that is required is to understand the visa process and what you have to do to get the right to pursue the activities that you are interested in, whatever they are.  There are usually specific visa programs that cover different activities like school, work or certain classes of longer-term visitors, such as young people on international exchange programs. Once you have figured out which program is right for you, then you just need to outline the steps that need to be followed so you apply and receive a visa that permits you to stay in the country legally.
Making friends and contacts in a new country

Using apps and the internet to find meetups, events and other places where you can meet people who share your interests and hobbies can be a good way to get to know people in a new country. Look at www.meetup.com, local news media or blogs or the bulletin boards outside places like universities, municipal buildings, or even popular bars/cafes for foreigners to find information in English that might be aimed at newcomers to a country. 

**Joining Volunteer Events**

Look for organizations that promote relationships between Japan and other countries, and there can be events where you can meet people that would be interesting to talk to about working in another country. The Chambers of Commerce for different countries have events which are open to non-members. These can be pricey but might offer a networking opportunity to learn more about jobs in other countries.
