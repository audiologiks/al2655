# Where do You Want to Work in the UK?

Have you decided where you want to live?

If you have decided you want to live in another country, how will you decide where to live? Do you have an interest in a specific country or city? Is there a job, hobby, sport or other field which is centered in a country overseas? People can decide to live overseas for many reasons but the one thing they have in common is that they have made it a priority for them to take that risk and embark on the challenge of living in a new country.
Making friends and contacts in a new country

Using apps and the internet to find meetups, events and other places where you can meet people who share your interests and hobbies can be a good way to get to know people in a new country. Look at www.meetup.com, local news media or blogs or bulletin boards outside places like universities, municipal buildings, or even popular bars/cafes for foreigners to find information in English that might be aimed at newcomers to a country.

**Joining Volunteer Events**

Look for organizations that promote relationships between Japan and other countries, and there can be events where you can meet people that would be interesting to talk to about working in another country. The Chambers of Commerce for different countries have events which are open to non-members. These can be pricey but might offer a networking opportunity to learn more about jobs in other countries.

All things being equal, you have to be a better candidate than a local candidate due to the requirement for a visa. The biggest barrier is the visa, which for example, is laid out in [Government websites](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/work-visas) such as the United Kingdom.
