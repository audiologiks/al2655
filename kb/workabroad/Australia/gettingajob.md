  If you are

</p>
<p>
  Skilled workers and business people interested in migrating to Australia can
  be considered for a skilled visa by submitting an Expression of Interest (EOI)
  through SkillSelect.<br>
  An EOI is an indication that you would like to be considered for a skilled visa.
  An EOI is not a visa application.<br>
  You will be asked to provide a range of information in your EOI depending on
  the visa you want to be considered for, such as:<br>
  • basic personal information<br>
  • nominated occupation<br>
  • work experience<br>
  • study and education<br>
  • level of English skills<br>
  • details of a skills assessment, related to your nominated occupation<br>
  • business and investment experience.<br>
  These skilled workers and business people can then be found and nominated for
  skilled visas by Australian employers or state and territory governments, or
  they might be invited by the Australian Government to lodge a visa application.<br>
  All people interested in the points based skilled migration or business investment
  and innovation visa programmes will need to submit an EOI and receive an invitation
  in order to lodge a visa application.<br>
  For more detail on what questions and information you will need to supply in
  your EOI, you should refer to the webpage of the visa you are interested in.
