# Resume/CV Styles
  The main difference between the western-style resume and the Japanese resume,
  is that while both contain information about your career, the Western-style one
  tries to convey more through the choice of wording and description while in Japanese
  it would just relay information.


## key Data Points in a Resume
  A company looking at a resume is looking for key data points in work history,
  skills and background though so in that sense they are both means to select the
  best candidates for the interview.

It depends on whether you prefer to write your resume in bullet point style or with a paragraph or two summarizing your experience in the job.

For example, one style might be:
