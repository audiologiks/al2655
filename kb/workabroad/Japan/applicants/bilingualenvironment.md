<p class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-text-align-left">
  <span class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Working in a bilingual environment in Japan can be very impactful and rewarding because you are learning something in one language or the other every day. Co-workers and customers can share experiences with you in their language that you can understand while you then might have to communicate some of that learning to colleagues across the globe. If you have never thought about a bilingual job, you can come to one of the meetups we sponsor or look at one of these bilingual job-boards.</span>

</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-text-align-left">
  <span class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium">No matter where you are on your journey, just starting out learning another language or having spoken one from birth, getting better in another language is a constant goal and can be easier through practice. If you are interested in another language, and you are good enough to have a conversation, you can take the next step and look for work in a bilingual environment. If you’re second language isn’t ready yet, you can search out ways to practice by participating in classes, groups or events that challenge you in Japanese or English.</span>

<p class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-text-align-left">
  <span class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium">With the current explosion of apps and mobile devices, it’s easier than ever to find information on things you are interested in. One benefit of working with people on a shared project or outside activity is the learning people can share on a subject. By finding people to talk with about what they do that is interesting to you, you can learn a lot and ask questions to further your own progress. If you want to share your knowledge with them, that is the type of exchange that is fundamental to language learning as well as starting to learn any new area of interest.</span>

</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-text-align-left">
  Learning on your own can be challenging just due to the time constraints of life,
  and the priorities you have. Work, school, family or friends, or anything else
  that you value also compete for the time you want to spend on a hobby or learning
  new skills so being more productive is a big help. Using time on the way to work
  or after dinner to work on a project, even 10-20 minutes can build a rhythm &nbsp;or
  help to find the right opportunity to start learning about an interest. Taking
  that next step to meeting more people interested in the same thing can happen
  when you are ready to share what you know, or what you don’t know and want to
  ask questions about.
