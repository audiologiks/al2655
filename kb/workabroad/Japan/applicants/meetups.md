Meetup is a popular app that helps people find meetings to attend in person or vitually around the world depending on topics that interest them.

We have held about 55 meetups over 5 years, with attendance from 1 to 15+ people each time, but averages a very small group. The Meetups are held around Tokyo at different co-working spaces but I often use one in Kayabacho

It is a really good Meetup focused on providing all the tools you need to concentrate and have a great gathering or individual session working on something. The staff and owner are very friendly.

To get there, you can take the subway to Kayabacho station.<a href="http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/search/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Plan your trip here (opens in Tokyo Metro website)</a>
