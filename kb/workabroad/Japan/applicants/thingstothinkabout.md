# Key Points When Looking for a Job

## Looking for a new job
  I'll post information on looking for jobs as I get it or find anything on the
  web. One key for many jobs is to improve your ability in Japanese and English
  as it can always distinguish you from others in your field. No matter how tough
  it can be, small improvements can lead to results in interviews and in the job
  so coming up with ways to learn and practice is always a good thing.

* What is your background and what kind of job do you want to do?
* Think about common points with your future job</span>
* Same industry as you worked in? You understand the business background.</span>
* Same role or working with the same stakeholders? (marketing, etc)</span>
* Understanding of connection between IT and the business goals and being able to explain it in interviews, and the results that it contributes to. This can be applied to the next job, whatever the underlying platform or technology is.
* What have you done so far to apply for a job

 **Applying to recruiters**
Getting contacted by a recruiter is helpful not only for the immediate job opportunity
but for the information they are willing to share. You can learn a lot about
the Tokyo job market by talking to a recruiter in your industry.

 **Joining job portals, uploading resumes**
Bilingual or international job boards are another helpful way of learning about
types of jobs open and the salaries they are likely to pay.
  
Find out the job portals for that industry or that country and look online for jobs. If you work in a large global company, check out global opportunities in your company. At a recent meetup, we had one member who had progressed to interviews but hadn’t managed to get an offer yet. We talked about competing with local candidates and how to show different attributes that give a candidate an edge over others. 
 
 * Personal networking, asking for introductions from friends and acquaintances
 * Introductions from networks, (alumni, business associations, meetups)
* Having a linkedin profile and applying directly to companies
* Looking for startups via Meetups, Justa.io and Angelist or [The Bridge](http://thebridge.jp/en/)
   
### Time for Finding a Job
The lead time for a job can be up to 3 months from resume submission to offer, with 4 or more interviews in office or via phone/video. Can be shorter for internships with a view to being permanent.

## Interviews
 * Simple greeting to the interviewer, shows knowledge of the culture and willingness to learn and use Japanese
 * It gets better with practice and can be a good summary of who you are. Simple and short is fine.
 * Concluding the Japanese part of the interview or leaving the interview, it is always good to say thanks.

If you know keigo great, but not necessary to worry about it during the interview. Japanese level is evaluated but even if you don’t know keigo, if you have a good command of business Japanese, or just are able to express yourself in standard Japanese, that is fine. Language ability is a threshold but keigo is very rarely the determining factor for a foreign hire.

### Using your Japanese
I believe it is good to include Japanese in the interview, even if you are N3 or N4 (JLPT levels).
* Go Aisatsu
* Jiko Shokai
* Thank you
* Keigo
   
### Other languages
If you know other languages it is a plus if they have a use within the hiring company</span>

Language of the home country - English, a European or Asian language, and/or any language in which the company conducts business in its home area.

Asian language - If the Asia headquarters is outside of Japan, it can be useful or beneficial to have command of Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese). Just a nice to have element on the resume unless you are specifically involved in supporting Chinese customers. </span>

On the other hand, if it isn’t related to the company’s business, there is no need to include a language unless there is fluency unless it’s an ongoing hobby or interest you want to mention in the interview.
   
### Determining Salary
Recruiters can be a big help in determining salaries, range for the position and whether your desired salary is reachable. Job portals and online websites also have good benchmarks.

Check out Daijob’s [salary database of candidates](https://www.daijob.com/en/ecompany/index.html). It can be a good view of the competition out there on the market

 ## Resume/CV Style
Check your resume or ask someone you trust to review your English resume. It should be in active voice, tying your actions to the results of your employer to show your value to the company.

Japanese and English versions of a resume are good to submit, hiring managers might prefer to use the Japanese version during the interview. It can be in the same format as your English resume, unless specifically requested to submit in “rirekisho” format.

## Self-education, Training resources
I use Youtube quite a lot, to view topics related to work that I am interested in. So for me, IT and Operations topics have a lot of resources on Youtube that give good overviews or summaries of topics. Topics I enjoy are Kanban and Devops.I have also used [Linkedin’s Lynda platform](https://www.lynda.com) for online courses.

Since I am interested in coding for the web, I have used [Coursera](href="https://www.coursera.org/) and [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
