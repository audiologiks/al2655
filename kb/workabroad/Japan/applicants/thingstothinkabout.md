# Key Points When Looking for a Job
<p>
  <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Looking for a new job</span></strong><br>
  I'll post information on looking for jobs as I get it or find anything on the
  web. One key for many jobs is to
  <span class="wysiwyg-underline">improve your ability in Japanese and English</span>
  as it can always distinguish you from others in your field. No matter how tough
  it can be, small improvements can lead to results in interviews and in the job
  so coming up with ways to learn and practice is always a good thing.

## Picking a recruiter
Getting contacted by a recruiter is helpful not only for the immediate job opportunity
but for the information they are willing to share. You can learn a lot about
the Tokyo job market by talking to a recruiter in your industry.

## Job boards

Bilingual or international job boards are another helpful way of learning about
types of jobs open and the salaries they are likely to pay.
  
Find out the job portals for that industry or that country and look online for jobs. If you work in a large global company, check out global opportunities in your company. At a recent meetup, we had one member who had progressed to interviews but hadnâ€™t managed to get an offer yet. We talked about competing with local candidates and how to show different attributes that give a candidate an edge over others.
