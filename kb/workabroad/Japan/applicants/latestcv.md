# Resume/CV Tips
Make sure you have your latest copy handy when you see a job you want to apply for, and that you have checked it out to 
ensure it says what you want and relates to the job you are applying for.

Storing your resume in the cloud, with services like Dropbox, Google Drive or others gives you an easy way to access for editing or to send via email. Downloading your resume and updating to reflect your latest experience, 
training or other achievements is essential.

## Applying over Linkedin
While some people are uncomfortable with posting their details on social sites like Linkedin due to the visibility to others, worries about their current company seeing it, and approaches from people and companies they don’t know, it does have many jobs posted by companies listed on its job section. It is worth filling out a bare bones profile with a minimum level of data, including just abbreviated last names, etc. in order to use the site to look for jobs and apply. 
You can alway apply directly on a company’s website or upload a resume for a job.
