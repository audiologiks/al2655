<p>
  Riot Games was established in 2006 by entrepreneurial gamers who believe that
  player-focused game development can result in great games. In 2009, Riot released
  its debut title&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;to critical and player acclaim.
  As the most played video game in the world, over 100 million play every month.
  Players form the foundation of our community and it’s for them that we continue
  to evolve and improve the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;experience.
</p>
<p>
  We’re looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach
  us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously;
  you’re passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, aren’t
  afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
</p>
<p>That's where you come in.</p>
<p>
  <strong>As Recruiter, you'll discover and court the best and brightest talent who value personal growth, collaboration, and the player experience above all. You'll be responsible for full-cycle recruiting in the Tokyo office, managing new candidates and giving potential Rioters a comprehensive look into how they'll use their skills to tackle meaty projects that foster engaging player experiences in Japan. With an eye for seeking those who thrive in a player-focused and results-oriented world, you're the investigative recruiter who knows that the best hires come from dutiful analysis, timely follow-ups and commitment to providing a seamless and positive recruiting experience.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  As a Tokyo Rioter, you'll join a team of internationally and culturally diverse
  professionals that share our obsession with player experience, rejection of convention,
  and passion for gaming. With teams in Player Support, Community, Publishing and
  Marketing, Riot Games Tokyo is dedicated to creating unique player experiences
  that show Japan based players they aren't lost in translation.

    <strong>Persuasive:</strong> you could sell a ketchup popsicle to a woman

  <li>
    <strong>Organized and agile:</strong> others can juggle a plate or two, but
