  Most recruiters in Japan are looking for candidates whose background and skills
  match the ones they think a client will want.
</p>
<p>
  If you contact a recruiter or a recruiter contacts you, they are looking to understand
  if you fit that profile. Depending on what area they specialize in (industry
  like IT, Finance, or Life Sciences) and the level of the candidate they handle
  (Junior, Mid-level, and Senior), you can try to tell if you are in their target
  area.

  So by sending a resume/cv to the recruiter and having a phone interview, you
  can set the stage for how they will view your strengths and weaknesses. Typically,
  a junior researcher will contact you to do an initial screening, and then schedule
  an inperson interview with one or more recruiters. Or you go to their office,
  have a language or skills test, and then review some sample opportunities.

  You should see if the opportunities they show you match your expectations, or
  what your career has been. If it involves a new field or skill, can you do the
  job and are you interested? If you get an interview with the hiring manager,
  can you reasonably explain how your background and skills help them to succeed?

  Getting feedback on the interview process is really helpful, but it is not always
  the focus of recruiters. You can judge a recruiter by the aftercare they provide,
  in that, if you tell them how you think the interview went, along with types
  of questions and focus, then the recruiter should give you feedback on the company's
  reaction to the interview.

</p>
<p>
  Sometimes the recruiter doesn't get that from the hiring company if the interview
  wasn't successful, and there are no specific feedback points that they share;
  but responsiveness to your questions can help you to decide when to focus on
  other job opportunities.
