  "The&nbsp;<strong>H-2B visa</strong>&nbsp;nonimmigrant program permits employers
  to hire&nbsp;<a title="Foreign worker" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_worker">foreign workers</a>&nbsp;to
  come temporarily to the&nbsp;<a title="United States" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>&nbsp;and
  perform temporary nonagricultural services or labor on a one-time, seasonal,
  peakload or intermittent basis.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-2B_visa#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>
  The H-2B visa classification requires the&nbsp;<a title="United States Secretary of Homeland Security" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security">United States Secretary of Homeland Security</a>&nbsp;to
  consult with appropriate agencies before admitting H-2B non-immigrants. Homeland
  Security regulations require that, except for Guam, the petitioning employer
  first apply for a temporary&nbsp;<a title="Labor certification" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_certification">labor certification</a>&nbsp;from
  the&nbsp;<a title="United States Secretary of Labor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor">United States Secretary of Labor</a>&nbsp;indicating
  that: (1) there are not sufficient U.S. workers who are capable of performing
  the temporary services or labor at the time of filing the petition for H-2B classification
  and at the place where the foreign worker is to perform the work; and (2) the
  employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working
  conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. The Department of Labor will review
  and process all H-2B applications on a first in, first out basis.<sup id="cite_ref-USLabor_2-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-2B_visa#cite_note-USLabor-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
  Employers seeking to employ temporary H-2B workers must apply for Temporary Employment
  Certification to the Chicago National Processing Center (NPC). An employer may
  submit a request for multiple unnamed foreign workers as long as each worker
  is to perform the same services or labor, on the same terms and conditions, in
  the same occupation, in the same area of intended employment during the same
  period of employment. Certification is issued to the employer, not the worker,
  and is not transferable from one employer to another or from one worker to another.<sup id="cite_ref-USLabor_2-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-2B_visa#cite_note-USLabor-2">[2]"</a></sup>
