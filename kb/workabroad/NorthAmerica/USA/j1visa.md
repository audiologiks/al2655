<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
  I had a nice talk with a member of the Meetup on Saturday,
  <a href="https://j1visa.state.gov%20about the J-1 visa program">and she told me about the J-1 visa program</a>.
  It seems to have different ways of entering and a variety of jobs available under
  it. As a first step to entering the US and working, I thought I would post details.
</p>
<p>
  "Around 300,000 participants from more than 200 countries and territories visit
  the United States on J-1 visas each year. Eighty-six percent are 30 years of
  age or younger. Fifty-four percent are women or girls. More than 1,400 designated
  U.S. sponsors participate in the program.
